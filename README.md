## Basic Overview

Fluid is an open-source .NET template engine that is as close as possible to the [Liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). It's a **secure** template language that is also **very accessible** for non-programmer audiences. It also contains an ASP.NET Core MVC View Engine.

<br>

## Features

- Parses and renders Liquid templates.
- Supports **async** filters, templates can execute database queries more efficiently under load.
- Parses templates in an intermediate **AST** that lets you analyze and alter the templates before they are rendered. You can also cache them to get even better performance.
- Register any .NET types and properties, or define **custom handlers** to intercept when a named variable is accessed.
- Secure by white-listing all the available properties in the template.

## Differences with Liquid

### Optional default parameters for custom filters
In Fluid a **Filter** doesn't need to have a default parameter, you can name all of them.

```Liquid
{% assign customers = 'allcustomers' | query: limit:10 %}
```

### Whitespace

Fluid will automatically maintain the whitespaces from the original template and won't inject extra lines where tags are used. This means that templates don't need to add extra `-%}` to the end of their tags to maintain consistent whitespaces. However it's supported and will be applied on output tags when used.

#### Source

```Liquid
<ul id="products">
  {% for product in products %}
    <li>
      <h2>{{product.name}}</h2>
      Only {{product.price | price }}

      {{product.description | prettyprint | paragraph }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

#### Result

```html
<ul id="products">
    <li>
      <h2>Apple</h2>
      $329

      Flat-out fun.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Orange</h2>
      $25

      Colorful. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Banana</h2>
      $99

      Peal it.
    </li>
</ul>
```

Notice
- The `<li>` tags are at the same index as in the template, even though the `{% for }` tag had some leading spaces
- The `<ul>` and `<li>` tags are on contiguous lines even though the `{% for }` is taking a full line.

<br>

## Using Fluid in your project

You can directly reference the [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fluid.Core).

### Hello World

#### Source

```csharp
var model = new { Firstname = "Bill", Lastname = "Gates" };
var source = "Hello {{ p.Firstname }} {{ p.Lastname }}";

if (FluidTemplate.TryParse(source, out var template))
{   
    var context = new TemplateContext();
    context.MemberAccessStrategy.Register(model.GetType()); // Allows any public property of the model to be used
    context.SetValue("p", model);

    Console.WriteLine(template.Render(context));
}
```

#### Result
`Hello Bill Gates`

<br>

## Adding custom filters

Filters can be **async** or not. They are defined as a `delegate` that accepts an **input**, a **set of arguments** and the current **context** of the rendering process.

Here is the `downcase` filter as defined in Fluid.

#### Source
```csharp
public static FluidValue Downcase(FluidValue input, FilterArguments arguments, TemplateContext context)
{
    return new StringValue(input.ToStringValue().ToLower());
}
```

#### Registration
Filters can be registered globally for the lifetime of the application, or for each usage of a template.

```csharp
TemplateContext.GlobalFilters.AddFilter('downcase', Downcase);

// Or for a specific context

var context = new TemplateContext();
context.Filters.AddFilter('downcase', Downcase);
```

To create an **async** filter use the `AddAsyncFilter` method instead.

<br>

## White-listing object members

Liquid is a secure template language which will only allow a predefined set of members to be accessed. Like filters, this can be done globally to the application  with `GlobalMemberAccessStrategy`, or for each context with `MemberAccessStrategy`. Even if a member is white-listed its value won't be able to be changed.

> Warning: To prevent concurrency issues you should always register global filters and members in a static constructor. Local ones can be defined at the time of usage.

### White-listing a specific type

This will allow any public field or property to be read from a template.

```csharp
TemplateContext.GlobalMemberAccessStrategy.Register<Person>();
``` 

### White-listing specific members

This will only allow the specied fields or properties to be read from a template.

```csharp
TemplateContext.GlobalMemberAccessStrategy.Register<Person>("Firstname", "Lastname");
``` 

### Intercepting a type access

This will provide a method to intercept when a member is accessed and either return a custom value or prevent it.

This example demonstrates how to intercept calls to a `JObject` and return the corresponding property.

```csharp
TemplateContext.GlobalMemberAccessStrategy.Register<JObject>((obj, name) => obj[name]);
``` 

### Inheritance

All the members of the class hierarchy are registered. Besides, all inherited classes will be correctly evaluated when a base class is registered and
a member of the base class is accessed.

<br>

## Converting CLR types

Whenever an object is manipulated in a template it is converted to a specific `FluidValue` instance that provides a dynamic type system somehow similar to the one in JavaScript.

In Liquid they can be Number, String, Boolean, Array, or Dictionary. Fluid will automatically convert the CLR types to the corresponding Liquid ones, and also provides specilized ones.

To be able to customize this conversion you can add type mappings

### Adding a type mapping

The following example shows how to support `JObject` and `JValue` types to map their values to `FluidValue` instances.

First is solves the issue that a `JObject` implements `IEnumerable` and would be converted to an `ArrayValue` instead of an `ObjectValue`. Then we use `FluidValue.Create` to automatically convert the CLR value of the `JValue` object.

```csharp
FluidValue.TypeMappings.Add(typeof(JObject), o => new ObjectValue(o));
FluidValue.TypeMappings.Add(typeof(JValue), o => FluidValue.Create(((JValue)o).Value));
```

> Note: Type mapping are defined globally for the application.

<br>

## Encoding

By default Fluid will encode any output variable into HTML using the `System.Text.Encodings.Web.HtmlEncoder` class. The encoder can be specified when calling `Render()` on the template. To render a template without any encoding use the `Fluid.NullEncoder.Default` instance.

Alternatively you can use a special `raw` filter to prevent a value from being encoded, for instance if you know that the content is HTML and is safe.

#### Source
```Liquid
{% assign html = '<em>This is some html</em>' %}

Encoded: {{ html }}
Not encoded: {{ html | raw }
```

#### Result
```html
&lt;em%gt;This is some html&lt;/em%gt;
<em>This is some html</em>
```

<br>

## Localization

By default templates are rendered using an _invariant_ culture so that the results are consistent across systems. This is important for instance when rendering dates, times and numbers.

However it is possible to define a specific culture to use when rendering a template using the `TemplateContext.CultureInfo` property. 

#### Source

```csharp
var context = new TemplateContext();
context.CultureInfo = new CultureInfo("en-US");
var result = template.Render(context);
```

```Liquid
{{ 1234.56 }}
{{ "now" | date: "%v" }}
```

#### Result
```html
1234.56
Tuesday, August 1, 2017
```

<br>

## Customizing tags and blocks

Fluid's grammar can be modified to accept any new tags and blocks with 
any custom parameters. It is even possible to use different grammars in 
the same application.

Unlike blocks, tags don't have a closing element (e.g., `cycle`, `increment`).
A closing element will match the name of the opening tag with and `end` suffix, like `endfor`.
Blocks are useful when manipulating a section of a a template as a set of statements.

To create a custom tag or block it is necessary to create a class implementing the `ITag` interface,
or for most common cases to just inherit from some of the availabe base classes.


### Creating a custom tag

Custom tags can use these base types:
- `SimpleTag`: Tag with no parameter, like `{% renderbody %}`
- `IdentifierTag`: Tag taking an identifier as parameter, like `{% increment my_variable %}`
- `ExpressionTag`: Tag taking an expression as parameter, like `{% layout template | default: 'layout' %}`
- `ArgumentsTag`: Tag taking a list of arguments as parameter, like `{% display 'default', arg1: 1 + 1 %}`
- `ITag`: Tag that can define any custom grammar.

Here are some examples:
#### Source

```csharp
public class QuoteTag : ExpressionTag
{
  public override async Task<Completion> WriteToAsync(TextWriter writer, TextEncoder encoder, TemplateContext context, Expression expression)
  {
    var value = (await expression.EvaluateAsync(context)).ToStringValue();
    await writer.WriteAsync("'" + value + "'");
    
    return Completion.Normal;
  }
}
```
```Liquid
{% quote 5 + 11 %}
```

#### Result
```html
'16'
```

### Creating a custom block

Blocks are created the same way as tags, with these classes: `SimpleBlock`, `IdentifierBlock`, `ExpressionBlock`, 'ArgumentsBlock` or `ITag`.

#### Source

```csharp
public class RepeatBlock : ExpressionBlock
{
  public override async Task<Completion> WriteToAsync(TextWriter writer, TextEncoder encoder, TemplateContext context, Expression expression, IList<Statements> statements)
  {
    var value = (await expression.EvaluateAsync(context)).ToNumberValue();
    for (var i=0; i < value; i++)
    {
      await RenderStatementsAsync(writer, encoder, context, statements);
    }

    return Completion.Normal;
  }
}
```

```Liquid
{% repeat 1 + 2 %}Hi! {% endrepeat %}
```

#### Result
```html
Hi! Hi! Hi!
```

### Defining a new template type

To prevent your customization from altering the default Liquid syntax, it is recommended to 
create a custom template type. 

#### Source
```csharp
using Fluid;

public class MyFluidTemplate : BaseFluidTemplate<MyFluidTemplate>
{
  static MyFluidTemplate()
  {
      Factory.RegisterTag<QuoteTag>("quote");
      Factory.RegisterBlock<RepeatBlock>("repeat");
  }
}
```

```csharp
MyFluidTemplate.TryParse(source, out var template);
```

### Examples

To see a complete example of a customized Fluid grammar, look at this class: [CustomGrammarTests](https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid/blob/dev/Fluid.Tests/CustomGrammarTests.cs)

<br>

## ASP.NET MVC View Engine

To provide a convenient view engine implementation for ASP.NET Core MVC the grammar is extended as described in [Customizing tags](#customizing-tags) by adding these new tags:

### Configuration

#### Registering the view engine

1- Reference the `Fluid.MvcViewEngine` nuget package
2- Add a `using` statement on `FluidMvcViewEngine`
3- Call `AddFluid()` in your `Startup.cs`.

#### Sample
```csharp
using FluidMvcViewEngine;

public class Startup
{
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddMvc().AddFluid();
    }
}
```
#### Registering view models

Because the Liquid language only accepts known members to be accessed, the View Model classes need to be registered in Fluid. Usually from a static constructor such that the code is run only once for the application.

#### View Model registration
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    static Startup()
    {
        TemplateContext.GlobalMemberAccessStrategy.Register<Person>();
    }
}
```

More way to register types and members can be found in the [White-listing object members](#white-listing-object-members) section.

### Layouts

#### Index.liquid

```Liquid
{% layout '_layout.liquid' %}

This is is the home page
```

The `{% layout [template] %}` tag accepts one argument which can be any expression that return the relative location of a liquid template that will be used as the master template.

The layout tag is optional in a view. It can also be defined multiple times or conditionally.

From a layout template the `{% renderbody %}` tag is used to depict the location of the view's content inside the layout itself.

#### Layout.liquid

```Liquid
<html>
  <body>
    <div class="menu"></div>
    
    <div class="content">
      {% renderbody %}
    </div>
    
    <div class="footer"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Sections

Sections are defined in a layout as for views to render content in specific locations. For instance a view can render some content in a **menu** or a **footer** section.

#### Rendering content in a section

```Liquid
{% layout '_layout.liquid' %}

This is is the home page

{% section menu %}
  <a href="h#">This link goes in the menu</a>
{% endsection %}

{% section footer %}
  This text will go in the footer
{% endsection %}
```

#### Rendering the content of a section

```Liquid
<html>
  <body>
    <div class="menu">
      {% rendersection menu %}
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
      {% renderbody %}
    </div>
    
    <div class="footer">
      {% rendersection footer %}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### ViewStart files

Defining the layout template in each view might me cumbersome and make it difficult to change it globally. To prevent that it can be defined in a `_ViewStart.liquid` file.

When a view is rendered all `_ViewStart.liquid` files from its current and parent directories are executed before. This means multiple files can be defined to defined settings for a group of views.

#### _ViewStart.liquid

```Liquid
{% layout '_layout.liquid' %}
{% assign background = 'ffffff' }
```

You can also define other variables or render some content.

### Execution

The content of a view is parsed once and kept in memory until the file or one of its dependencies changes. Once parsed, the tag are executed every time the view is called. To compare this with Razor, where views are first compiled then instantiated every time they are rendered. This means that on startup or when the view is changed, views with Fluid will run faster than those in Razor, unless you are using precompiled Razor views. In all cases Razor views will be faster on subsequent calls as they are compiled directly to C#.

This difference makes Fluid very adapted for rapid development cycles where the views can be deployed and updated frequently. And because the Liquid language is secure, developers give access to them with more confidence.  

<br>

## Performance

### Caching

Some performance boost can be gained in your application if you decide to cache the parsed templates before they are rendered. Even though parsing is memory-safe as it won't induce any compilation (meaning all the memory can be collected if you decide to parse a lot of templates), you can skip the parsing step by storing and reusing the `FluidTemplate` instance.

These object are thread-safe as long as each call to `Render()` uses a dedicated `TemplateContext` instance.

### Benchmarks

A performance benchmark application is provided in the source code to compare Fluid, DotLiquid and Liquid .NET. Run it locally to analyze the time it takes to execute specific templates.
